C++ minesweeper clone using SFML library


# Overwiew
This is one of my first projects. The purpose of its creation was to learn object-oriented programming in C++ and the use of external libraries. I used the SFML library because it is easy to learn and it is great for the purpose of creating a simple two-dimensional game.
